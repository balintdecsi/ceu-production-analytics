## Location

In-person at the Vienna campus (QS B-421).

## Syllabus

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

1. You need a laptop with any operating system and stable Internet connection.
2. Please make sure that Internet/network firewall rules are not limiting your access to unusual ports (e.g. 22, 8787, 8080, 8000), as we will heavily use these in the class (can be a problem on a company network). CEU WiFi should have the related firewall rules applied for the class.
3. Join the Teams channel dedicated to the class at `CEU BA DE3 Batch Jobs and APIs ('25/26)` with the `c1vc62r` team code.
4. When joining remotely, it's highly suggested to get a second monitor where you can follow the online stream, and keep your main monitor for your own work. The second monitor could be an external screen attached to your laptop, e.g. a TV, monitor, projector, but if you don't have access to one, you may also use a tablet or phone to dial-in to the Zoom call.

## Class Schedule

To be updated weekly.

## Week 1

**Goal**: learn how to run and schedule Python or R jobs in the cloud.

### Background: Example use-cases and why to use R in the cloud?

Excerpts from https://daroczig.github.io/talks

* "A Decade of Using R in Production" (Real Data Science USA - R meetup)
* "Getting Things Logged" (RStudio::conf 2020)

### Welcome to AWS!

1. Use the following sign-in URL to access the class AWS account: https://657609838022.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
2. Secure your access key(s), other credentials and any login information ...

    <details><summary>... because a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others!</summary>

    > "When I woke up the next morning, I had four emails and a missed phone call from Amazon AWS - something about 140 servers running on my AWS account, mining Bitcoin"
    -- [Hoffman said](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots)

    So set up 2FA (go to IAM / Users / username / Security credentials / Assigned MFA device): https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam

    PS probably you do not really need to store any access keys, but you may rely on roles (and the Key Management Service, and the Secrets Manager and so on)
    </details>

3. Let's use the `eu-west-1` Ireland region

### Getting access to EC2 boxes

**Note**: we follow the instructions on Windows in the Computer Lab, but please find below how to access the boxes from Mac or Linux as well when working with the instances remotely.

1. Create (or import) an SSH key in AWS (EC2 / Key Pairs): https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#KeyPairs:sort=keyName including using the Owner tag!
2. Get an SSH client:

    * Windows -- Download and install PuTTY: https://www.putty.org
    * Mac -- Install PuTTY for Mac using homebrew or macports

        ```sh
        sudo brew install putty
        sudo port install putty
        ```

    * Linux -- probably the OpenSSH client is already installed, but to use the same tools on all operating systems, please install and use PuTTY on Linux too, eg on Ubuntu:

        ```sh
        sudo apt install putty
        ```

3. ~~Convert the generated pem key to PuTTY format~~No need to do this anymore, AWS can provide the key as PPK now.

    * GUI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html#putty-private-key
    * CLI:

        ```sh
        puttygen key.pem -O private -o key.ppk
        ```

4. Make sure the key is readable only by your Windows/Linux/Mac user, eg

    ```sh
    chmod 0400 key.ppk
    ```

### Create and connect to an EC2 box

1. Create an EC2 instance

    0. Optional: create an Elastic IP for your box
    1. Go the the Instances overview at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:sort=instanceId
    2. Click "Launch Instance"
    3. Provide a name for your server (e.g. `daroczig-de3-week1`) and some additional tags for resource tracking, including tagging downstream services, such as Instance and Volumes:
        * Class: `DE3`
        * Owner: `daroczig`
    4. Pick the `Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type` AMI
    5. Pick `t3a.small` (2 GiB of RAM should be enough for most tasks) instance type (see more [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types))
    6. Select your AWS key created above and launch
    7. Update the volume size to 20 GiB to make sure we have enough space.
    8. Pick a unique name for the security group after clicking "Edit" on the "Network settings"
    9. Click "Launch instance"
    10. Note and click on the instance id

2. Connect to the box

    1. Specify the hostname or IP address

    ![](hhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/putty-session-config.png)

    2. Specify the "Private key file for authentication" in the Connection category's SSH/Auth/Credentials pane
    3. Set the username to `ubuntu` on the Connection/Data tab
    4. Save the Session profile
    5. Click the "Open" button
    6. Accept & cache server's host key

Alternatively, you can connect via a standard SSH client on a Mac or Linux, something like:

```sh
chmod 0400 /path/to/your/pem
ssh -i /path/to/your/pem ubuntu@ip-address-of-your-machine
```

As a last resort, use "EC2 Instance Connect" from the EC2 dashboard by clicking "Connect" in the context menu of the instance (triggered by right click in the table).

### Install RStudio Server on EC2

Yes, although most of you are using Python, we will install RStudio Server (with
support for both R and Python), as it comes with a lot of useful features for
the coming hours at this class (e.g. it's most complete and production-ready open-source IDE supporting multiple users and languages).

1. Look at the docs: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server
2. First, we will upgrade the system to the most recent version of the already installed packages. Note, check on the concept of a package manager!

    Download Ubuntu `apt` package list:

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    ```

    Optionally upgrade the system:

    ```sh
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

    And optionally also reboot so that kernel upgrades can take effect.

3. Install R

    ```sh
    sudo apt install r-base
    ```

    To avoid manually answering "Yes" to the question to confirm installation, you can specify the `-y` flag:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y r-base
    ```

4. Try R

    ```sh
    R
    ```

    For example:

    ```r
    1 + 4
    # any ideas what this command does?
    hist(runif(100))
    # duh, where is the plot?!
    ```

    Exit:

    ```r
    q()
    ```

    Look at the files:

    ```sh
    ls
    ls -latr
    ```

    Note, if you have X11 server installed, you can forward X11 through SSH to
    render locally, but this can be complicated to set up on a random operating
    system, and also not very convenient, so we will not bother with it for now.

5. Try this in Python as well!

    ```sh
    $ python
    Command 'python' not found, did you mean:
      command 'python3' from deb python3
      command 'python' from deb python-is-python3

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.12.3
    ```

    Let's symlink `python` to `python3` to make it easier to use:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install python-is-python3
    ```

    And install `matplotlib`:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install python3-matplotlib
    ```

    Then replicate that histogram:

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import random

    numbers = [random.random() for _ in range(100)]
    plt.hist(numbers)
    plt.show()
    ```

    But uh oh, there's no plot!

    ```python
    plt.savefig("python.png")
    ```

5. Install RStudio Server

    ```sh
    wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/jammy/amd64/rstudio-server-2026.01.0-392-amd64.deb
    sudo apt install -y gdebi-core
    sudo gdebi rstudio-server-2026.01.0-392-amd64.deb
    ```

6. Check process and open ports

    ```sh
    rstudio-server status
    sudo rstudio-server status
    sudo systemctl status rstudio-server
    sudo ps aux | grep rstudio

    sudo apt -y install net-tools
    sudo netstat -tapen | grep LIST
    sudo netstat -tapen
    ```

7. Look at the docs: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/

### Connect to the RStudio Server

1. Confirm that the service is up and running and the port is open

    ```console
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-150:~$ sudo ss -tapen | grep LIST
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8787            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          49065       23587/rserver
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          15671       1305/sshd
    tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      0          15673       1305/sshd
    ```

2. Try to connect to the host from a browser on port 8787, eg http://foobar.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8787
3. Realize it's not working
4. Open up port 8787 in the security group, by selecting your security group and click "Edit inbound rules":

    ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/495736/222724348-869d0703-05f2-4ef3-bd80-574362e73265.png)

Now you should be able to access the service. If not, e.g. blocked by company firewall, don't worry, we can workaround that by using a proxy server -- to be set up in the next section.

### Set up an easy to remember IP address

Optionally you can associate a fixed IP address to your box, so that the IP address is not changing when you stop and start the box.

1. Allocate a new Elastic IP address at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Addresses:
2. Name this resource by assigning the "Name" and "Owner" tags
3. Associate this Elastic IP with your stopped box, then start it

### Set up an easy to remember domain name

Optionally you can associate a subdomain with your node, using the above created Elastic IP address:

1. Go to Route 53: https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home
2. Go to Hosted Zones and click on `de3.click`
3. Create a new `A` record:

    - fill in the desired `Record name` (subdomain), eg `foobar` (well, use your own username as the subdomain)
    - paste the public IP address or hostname of your server in the `Value` field
    - click `Create records`

4. Now you will be able to access your box using this custom (sub)domain, no need to remember IP addresses.

### Configuring for standard ports

To avoid using ports like `8787` and `8080` (and get blocked by the firewall installed on the CEU WiFi), let's configure our services to listen on the standard 80 (HTTP) and potentially on the 443 (HTTPS) port as well, and serve RStudio on the `/rstudio`, and later Jenkins on the `/jenkins` path.

For this end, we will use Caddy as a reverse-proxy, so let's install it first:

```shell
sudo apt install -y caddy
```

Then let's edit the main configuration file `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, which also do some transformations, eg rewriting the URL (removing the `/rstudio` path) before hitting RStudio Server. To edit the file, we can use the `nano` editor:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

If you are not familiar with the `nano` editor, check the keyboard shortcuts at
the bottom of the screen, e.g. `^X` (Ctrl+X keys pressed simultaneously) to
exit, or `M-A` (Alt+A keys pressed simultaneously) to start marking text for
later copying or deleting.

Delete everything (either by patiently pressing the `Delete` or `Backspace`
keys, or by pressing `M-A`, then navigating to the bottom of the file and
pressing `^K`), and copy/paste (Shift+Insert or Ctrl+Shift+C) the following
content:

```
:80 {
    redir /rstudio /rstudio/ permanent
    handle_path /rstudio/* {
        reverse_proxy localhost:8787 {
            transport http {
                read_timeout 20d
            }
            # need to rewrite the Location header to remove the port number
            # https://caddy.community/t/reverse-proxy-header-down-on-location-header-or-something-equivalent/13157/3
            header_down  Location ([^:]+://[^:]+(:[0-9]+)?/)  ./
        }
    }
}
```

And restart the Caddy service:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart caddy
```

Find more information at https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552326-Running-RStudio-Server-with-a-Proxy.

Let's see if the port is open on the machine:

```shell
sudo ss -tapen|grep LIST
```

Let's see if we can access RStudio Server on the new path:

```shell
curl localhost/rstudio
```

Now let's see from the outside world ... and realize that we need to open up port 80!

Now we need to tweak the config to support other services as well in the future e.g. Jenkins:

```
:80 {
    redir /rstudio /rstudio/ permanent
    handle_path /rstudio/* {
        reverse_proxy localhost:8787 {
            transport http {
                read_timeout 20d
            }
            # need to rewrite the Location header to remove the port number
            # https://caddy.community/t/reverse-proxy-header-down-on-location-header-or-something-equivalent/13157/3
            header_down  Location ([^:]+://[^:]+(:[0-9]+)?/)  ./
        }
    }

    handle /jenkins/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
    }
}
```

It might be useful to also proxy port 8000 for future use via updating the Caddy config to:

```
:80 {
    redir /rstudio /rstudio/ permanent
    handle_path /rstudio/* {
        reverse_proxy localhost:8787 {
            transport http {
                read_timeout 20d
            }
            # need to rewrite the Location header to remove the port number
            # https://caddy.community/t/reverse-proxy-header-down-on-location-header-or-something-equivalent/13157/3
            header_down  Location ([^:]+://[^:]+(:[0-9]+)?/)  ./
        }
    }

    handle /jenkins/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
    }

    handle_path /8000/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
    }
}
```

This way you can access the above services via the below URLs:

RStudio Server:

* http://your.ip.address:8787
* http://your.ip.address/rstudio

Jenkins:

* http://your.ip.address:8080/jenkins
* http://your.ip.address/jenkins

Port 8000:

* http://your.ip.address:8000
* http://your.ip.address/8000

If you cannot access RStudio Server on port 80, you might need to restart `caddy` as per above.

It's useful to note that above paths in the index page as a reminder, that you can achive by adding the following to the Caddy configuration:

```
handle / {
    respond "Welcome to DE3! Are you looking for /rstudio or /jenkins?" 200
}
```

Next, you might really want to set up SSL either with Caddy or placing an AWS
Load Balancer in front of the EC2 node. For a simple setup, we can realy on
Caddy's built-in SSL support using LetsEncrypt:

1. Register a domain name (or use the already registered `de3.click` domain
   subdomain), and point it to your EC2 node's public IP address:
   https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones
2. You might need to wait a bit for the DNS to propagate. Check via `dig` or similar, e.g.:

    ```
    dig foobar.de3.click
    ```

3. Update the Caddy configuration to use the new domain name instead of `:80` in
   `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

    ```
    foobar.de3.click {
        redir /rstudio /rstudio/ permanent
        handle_path /rstudio/* {
            reverse_proxy localhost:8787 {
                transport http {
                    read_timeout 20d
                }
                # need to rewrite the Location header to remove the port number
                # https://caddy.community/t/reverse-proxy-header-down-on-location-header-or-something-equivalent/13157/3
                header_down  Location ([^:]+://[^:]+(:[0-9]+)?/)  ./
            }
        }

        handle /jenkins/* {
            reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
        }

        handle_path /8000/* {
            reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
        }

        handle / {
            respond "Welcome to DE3! Are you looking for /rstudio or /jenkins?" 200
        }
    }
    ```

4. Caddy will then automatically obtain and renew the SSL certificate using
   LetsEncrypt, and you will be able to access the services via the new domain
   name through HTTPS. If you are interested in the related logs, you can view
   them in the Caddy logs:

    ```shell
    sudo journalctl -u caddy
    # follow logs
    sudo journalctl -u caddy
    ```

### Connect again to the RStudio Server

1. Authentication: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html
2. Create a new user:

    ```shell
    sudo adduser foobar
    ```

3. Login & quick demo:

    ```r
    1+2
    plot(runif(100))
    install.packages('fortunes')
    library(fortunes)
    fortune()
    fortune(200)
    system('whoami')
    ```

4. Reload webpage (F5), realize we continue where we left the browser :)

5. Create a Python script and try to run it (in class: don't run it yet, just pay attention to the shared screen):

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import random

    numbers = [random.random() for _ in range(100)]
    plt.hist(numbers)
    plt.show()
    ```

    Note that RStudio Server will ask you to confirm the installation of a few
    packages ... which takes ages (compiling C++ etc), so we better install the
    binary packages instead:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends \
      r-cran-jsonlite r-cran-reticulate r-cran-png
    ```

    Now return to the Python script. But we still cannot run it, as the
    `matplotlib` package is not installed. Strange, we just installed it in the
    shell! To understand what's happening, get back to R and check the Python
    interpreter:

    ```r
    reticulate::py_config()
    reticulate::py_require("matplotlib")
    ```

    Note that this is a temporary virtual environment, so you need to install
    the packages again if you restart the R session.

    Now the script runs .. until you restart the R session.

    So let's create a persistent virtual environment for Python and install the
    packages there:

    ```r
    library(reticulate)
    virtualenv_create("de3")
    virtualenv_install("de3", packages = c("matplotlib"))
    use_virtualenv("de3", required = TRUE)
    ```

    Note that creating the virtual environment failed due to some missing OS dependencies (e.g. `pip`),
    so let's install them first in the shell:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip python3-dev
    ```

    Then run the following commands in R, and then try to rerun the Python
    script as well. You might need to restart R and go to the `Tools` menu /
    `Global Options` / `Python` / `Use Virtual Environment` and select the `de3`
    environment.

    Now return to the Python script again, and rerun your script.

6. Annoyed already with switching between R and Python? And then switching to
    SSH? Let's try to simplify that by using the built-in terminal in RStudio:

    ```console
    $ whoami
    ceu
    $ sudo whoami
    ceu is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
    ```

7. Grant sudo access to the new user by going back to SSH with `root` access:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install -y mc
    sudo mc
    sudo mcedit /etc/sudoers
    sudo adduser ceu admin
    man adduser
    man deluser
    ```

    Note 1: might need to relogin / restart RStudio / reload R / reload page .. to force a new shell login so that the updated group setting is applied

    Note 2: you might want to add `NOPASSWD` to the `sudoers` file:

    ```sh
    ceu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    ```

    Although also note (3) the related security risks.

8. Custom login page: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html#customizing-the-sign-in-page

### Python playground

Great, we have a working environment for R and Python.
Now let's try to do something useful with it!

Create a Python or R script to get the most recent Bitcoin <> USD prices (e.g.
from the Binance API), report the last price and the price change in the last 1
hour, and plot a line chart of the price history, something like:

```
BTC current price is $42,000, with a standard deviation of 100.
```

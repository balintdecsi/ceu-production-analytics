## Syllabus

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

1. You need a laptop with any operating system and stable Internet connection.
2. Please make sure that Internet/network firewall rules are not limiting your access to unusual ports (e.g. 22, 8787, 8080, 8000), as we will heavily use these in the class (can be a problem on a company network). CEU WiFi should have the related firewall rules applied for the class.
3. Join the Teams channel dedicated to the class at `ba-de4-2024` with the `symvo7f` team code
4. When joining remotely, it's highly suggested to get a second monitor where you can follow the online stream, and keep your main monitor for your own work. The second monitor could be an external screen attached to your laptop, e.g. a TV, monitor, projector, but if you don't have access to one, you may also use a tablet or phone to dial-in to the Zoom call.

## Class Schedule

Will be updated from week to week.
